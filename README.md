## Fatigue Life Calculator Tool  
# Overview  
The Fatigue Life Calculator Tool is an intuitive application designed using Tkinter to assist engineers, researchers, and materials scientists in evaluating the fatigue life of metals. By inputting specific parameters related to the material and loading conditions, the tool calculates both the accumulated damage and the estimated remaining life of the metal. This ensures accurate predictions for the durability of components subjected to cyclic stresses, crucial for design, maintenance, and safety assessments.

# Features
Damage Calculation: Computes the cumulative damage incurred by the metal under cyclic loading.  
Life Estimation: Estimates the remaining life of the metal based on specified conditions.  
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and interactive GUI developed using Tkinter, making it accessible even for users with minimal programming experience.  
Customizable Parameters: Input parameters can be adjusted based on specific material properties and loading conditions.
